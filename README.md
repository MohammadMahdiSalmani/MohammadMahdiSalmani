# Hi, I’m MohammadMahdi Salmani👋

## 🔍 About Me
A Front-end Developer based in Tehran, IR. Who loves solving problems and building web applications, 
with passion for learning new technologies. Skilled in my SKILLS.
I began learning web development nearly four years ago. After I grasped the basics, I started learning 
the PHP language. Finally, I figured out my favorite side. I continued client-side with React js. Every 
day I try to learn more about my profession and I am trying to be better than I was yesterday.

## 🌱 Portfolio
In my opinion, having a personal website can be useful in order to interact with the target user and 
also be a good example to show the skills in design and coding to the employer. So I decided to create 
my own website and upload my projects there (You can also visit them here).\
